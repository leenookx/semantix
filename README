This is an experiment with data mining and semantic webby things. Who knows where this will go (probably nowhere) as this is going to be highly experimental based off of random thoughts that enter my head.

Hang onto your seats 'cos it's going to be a bumpy ride! ;)


Feel free to send me any suggestions!


Requirements
------------

This is a ruby-on-rails based application, so you need that!

Also:
    ferret
    acts_as_ferret (although this is installed as a plugin)
    chronic
    packet
    feed-normalizer
    workling
    memcached (used by workling)
    memcache-client (used by worklin)
    daemons (used by workling)
    starling (used by workling)
    leenookx-feed-utils

These can be easily installed:

    rake gems:install


Installation
------------

There's no real installation steps except for downloading the code from the github repository at http://github.com/leenookx/semantix/tree/master.

You will need to create a keys.yml file which contains your API access keys for the various web-based systems that semantix communicates with. Currently these are:

    * OpenCalais: http://www.opencalais.com

So, your keys.yml file needs to look something like this:

    calais:
        <key>


Running
-------

To run the system simply execute the following in a console window:

    # cd semantix
    # script/server
    # starling -d -P tmp/pids/starling.pid -q log/
    # scripts/workling_client start

now, make sure your crobtab contains:

*/5 * * * * $RAILS_ROOT/app/crontab/feeder.sh
0,30 * * * * $RAILS_ROOT/app/crontab/twitter_trends.sh

then, point your browser at http://localhost:3000 and away you go!


Interactivity
-------------

As it's my intention for the system to be an interactive service, I've set up some ways for you to interact with it:

    email:   semantix2009@googlemail.com
    twitter: semantix2009

NOTE: At the moment there are no ingestion mechanisms associated with them, but watch this space as they should be soon.
